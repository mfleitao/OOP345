1) The reason for specializing the sum() member function.

The reason for this specializing is because the first version of sum() assumes that the parameter
passed is a number, so that's why we needed another template with a different signature for string, because
this second version make concatenates two values with a " " (space) because them. 


2) The reason for specializing the initial value for a summation.

As mentioned before at the first question, a specializing for the "initial" member was necessary
because it can be interpreted as a number or as a string, so that's why it's initialized for both types.


3) The reason for defining the class variable outside the class definition.

Because a class variable is a static member and it belongs to class. Its context requires another 
template declaration to initializes it.
